WRTIE OUT WHAT YOUR CURRENT OBJECTIVE IS HERE AND DO NOT DEVIATE FROM THAT UNTIL YOU'VE COMPLETED THIS OBJECTIVE, OR YOU'VE HIT A BRICKWALL AND NEED TO FOCUS ON A DIFFERENT ASPECT OF THE PROJECT - MAKE SURE TO WRITE THAT NEW OBJECTIVE HERE IN PLACE OF THE OLD ONE

Current Task: 
- Figure out how to get the project in #project-display-div to update and change which project is active on click.
- There is a .active-project css class which will need to be cleared and re-assigned each time a new project is clicked. Make sure that this tracks with the user actions properly
- Once this is set up, the project select element in #input-container will need to update the select options with all values in the projectList array

- Implement localStorage, tests work differently for standard browser pages and incognito browser pages, so tests in incognito may not be able to retrieve key value pairs from the Storage objective
